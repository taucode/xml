==========
    1. ElementBase.UnboundSchema returns null, but ElementBase is still abstract.
    2. Disallow recursive serialization
    3. Element must not be struct, interface, abstract etc.
    4. Unbound schema is restrictive => cannot add attrs/elements
    5. Element type is kinda "sealed", i.e. must exactly match, no ancestors allowed. Same for element lists.
    6. Support camel-case via settings, not (only) via attributes (attributes have priviledge of course).
    7. Support dictionaries (future releases)
    8. Support POCO serialization/deserialization (future releases)
